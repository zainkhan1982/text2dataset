# MongoDB Integration for text2dataset

## Overview

This document describes the MongoDB integration implemented for the text2dataset application to store history data and community data persistently.

## Connection Details

- **MongoDB Atlas URI**: `mongodb+srv://Zain_admin:2ea898dxeI%40@cluster0.flv8jkk.mongodb.net/`
- **Database Name**: `text2dataset`
- **Collections**:
  - `dataset_history` - Stores dataset generation history
  - `community_datasets` - Stores community-shared datasets

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dataset History Module (`dataset_history.py`)

- Added MongoDB support while maintaining backward compatibility with file-based storage
- Modified to use `pymongo` for database operations
- Created `dataset_history` collection in MongoDB
- Updated all methods to work with both MongoDB and file storage

### 2. Community Datasets Module (`community_datasets.py`)

- Enhanced existing MongoDB support
- Fixed collection checking issues
- Ensured proper error handling for MongoDB operations
- Updated all methods to work with both MongoDB and file storage

### 3. Main Application (`app.py`)

- Updated to use MongoDB-enabled instances of both modules
- Modified health check endpoint to verify MongoDB connectivity
- Updated type hints for dataset IDs to support both int and string (MongoDB ObjectIDs)

## Benefits

1. **Persistent Storage**: Data is now stored in MongoDB rather than local files
2. **Scalability**: MongoDB provides better scalability for larger datasets
3. **Reliability**: Cloud-based MongoDB Atlas ensures data durability
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Application still works with file-based storage if MongoDB is unavailable

## Testing

- Verified MongoDB connectivity for both modules
- Tested data insertion and retrieval
- Confirmed health check endpoint reports MongoDB status
- Validated existing functionality still works

## Running the Application

1. Ensure MongoDB URI is correctly configured
2. Run the application with `python app.py`
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8003`
4. Check health status at `http://localhost:8003/health`

## Future Improvements

1. Add authentication for MongoDB connections
2. Implement connection pooling for better performance
3. Add data backup and recovery mechanisms
4. Implement data migration tools from file-based to MongoDB storage
